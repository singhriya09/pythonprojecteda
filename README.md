INTRODUCTION
Education is the cornerstone of a nation's progress, and ensuring that students have access to quality infrastructure is fundamental to their academic and personal development. In a country as vast and diverse as India, schools operate under various management types—government, private, and aided—and are spread across urban and rural areas with varying levels of access to basic facilities. Infrastructure elements such as electricity, drinking water, functional toilets, clean classrooms, computers, and internet connectivity directly influence the learning environment and the effectiveness of the education system. While several national programs have been implemented to improve these conditions, disparities still persist across different regions and types of schools. This data science project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the availability and distribution of essential infrastructure and facilities in Indian schools, focusing on key aspects such as management type, state-wise performance, digital readiness, gender-based access, and rural-urban gaps. By leveraging data, this study seeks to uncover critical insights that can support data-driven decision-making in the education sector.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Analyze the availability of basic infrastructure and facilities in schools across different state and management types in INDIA.

OBJECTIVE:
1.	Evaluating Basic Facility Access in Schools Across India Analyze the overall availability of key infrastructure facilities such as electricity, drinking water, computers, libraries, and playgrounds. This helps assess the baseline quality of school environments across the country. The goal is to understand which facilities are most or least accessible to students.
2.	Infrastructure Availability by School Management Type Compare how infrastructure availability differs across schools managed by different authorities like government departments, private organizations, and aided institutions. This comparison helps reveal systemic strengths or gaps in resource allocation among various school management types.
3.	Infrastructure Availability by School Category: Analyze infrastructure availability across different school categories such as Primary, Upper Primary, and Secondary schools. This helps in understanding how infrastructure development progresses with educational level and identifies any underdeveloped stages in the schooling system.
4.	Distribution of Fully Equipped vs Under-equipped Schools Classify schools based on whether they have all essential infrastructure facilities available or are lacking one or more. The goal is to identify how many schools meet complete infrastructure standards and how widespread under-equipped schools are across the dataset.
5.	Infrastructure Analysis in Rural Areas Compare the availability of key facilities like drinking water, electricity, toilets, furniture, and handwashing across rural and urban schools. This helps uncover rural-urban disparities in school infrastructure and supports targeted improvements in underserved regions
